## Description
Developer name: Danylo Shkundalov

Since project is small (8 kb) and desn't need any special framework's elements/functions it were done by vanilla - connecting frameworks that are 100 times bigger than project in not the best option, but main functions are described as they could be done with using jQuery. Optimized to less code and good performance. All elements are documented. Ready to answer any additional questions.


Thank you.
