## Description
Developer name: Danylo Shkundalov

Since project is small (8kb) it were done as vanilla, connecting frameworks that are 100 times bigger than all project
in not the best option because project desn't need any special elements, but main functions are described as they could be done
with using jQuery. Optimized to less code and good performance.

Thank you.
