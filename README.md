# FX Calculator

## Usage
In order to view the application - just open the index.html file in a web-browser.

## Known issues
Due to the fact, that third-party exchange rate data providers don't allow changes to the base currency without a paid subscription - all conversion are done using an intermediary base currency (EUR). While this isn't entirely correct - it is a limitation of available data and therefore, currently unavoidable.

## Description
